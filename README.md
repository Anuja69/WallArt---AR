### A dummy Ecommerce app consisting of features such has,
* User can experience product's 3D Model in AR World.
* Later Can Buy It.

### Description
The system basically uses a mobile phone built-in camera that supports Augmented reality
to collect views as the real scene view observed by the human eye and stacks the 3D models
on the screen displayed. Application that takes the real view as input with the help of an AR camera and then processes it with a virtual object
to get the resultant output as an augmented display.


### Steps
- First, the user selects the model of interest, then scans the neighbourhood using the camera of the device and keeps the model to check if it satisfies our needs. 

- User interacts with an application using an Android device that supports an AR camera.

- Application places selected model on the desired place of the user.

- After placing, the user gets an idea about how the model is suited in the enviroment


### Implemention 

The application implementation consists of four modules.
- Creating and Importing Augmented Reality Objects.
- Designing Views for the User Interface.
- Build an APK file.
- Place the Object on the Surface Area.

- Creating and Importing Augmented Reality Objects: The 3D models used in the application are made in Blender and some of them are directly imported from SketchFab are imported using sketchfab. It consists of .glb extension models.

- Development and Designing for User Interface: In this module, we create an environment for each model of the application using Blender software. Some of the models are imported from Sketchfab. Model details such as size, aspect ratio, rotation, etc are stored in a Productâ€™s Details column. During this Android Studio is used to
make the application and integrates the 3D models in the Raw folder.

- Build an APK File: After composing all the applications needed, the next step is to build
the project and build an APK file that will run on an Android device.

- Place the Object on the Surface Area: In this scenario, we use the Google SceneForm
package, which is used to import and display 3D Objects, and by modifying the package to
help us scan the surface of the environment in the real world where the virtual object needed
to be placed. After making changes to the core of Google AR, we will create a view in such
a way that after scanning the surface and pressing the button on the touch screen, the virtual
3D model is displayed or integrated with the area on the screen, so that the user can meet
their needs and check the furniture.
